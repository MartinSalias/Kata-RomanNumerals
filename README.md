Kata-RomanNumerals
==================

Versions of this kata over time

User Story: As Asterix, I want to transform arabic numbers to Roman, to verify Romans are all crazy

SPECS
-----

- Zero does not exist (Caesar said so)
- There are no negative numbers (the Roman Empire never shrinks)
- We won't implement beyond 59 (just to abreviate)

- Conversion table
  I = 1
  V = 5
  X = 10
  L = 50
  C = 100
  D = 500
  M = 1000

- Rules (implicit)
  I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, and so on...
